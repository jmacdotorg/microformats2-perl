Revision history for Web::Microformats2

{{$NEXT}}

    - Added support for parsing and presenting "rel" attributes.
    
    - Improved support for implied microformat "value" data.
    
    - Added partial support for implied dates (regarding parsed datetime
    properties that specify a time but no date).
    
    - All 74 of the official Microformats2 tests pass now -- or slightly
    updated versions of them, anyway -- so removed all the TODO stuff
    from the test suite.

    - Improved parsing and presentation of datetime properties.
    
    - Updated the tests to account for recent specification changes. (As
    a happy side effect, eleven formerly TODO-marked tests now run and
    pass.)

0.4 2018-05-18T13:10:37Z

    - Tests should now pass with older Perl versions. (GitHub issue #1;
    thanks to Slaven ReziÄ‡ for the bug report.)
    
    - Adding Travis config.

    - Miscellaneous minor documentation and testing improvements.

    Microformats2 items.

0.02 2018-04-20T19:59:48Z

    - Changing the public method used for returning a item's types.
